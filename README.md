# hello-world

Hey everyone! 

Welcome to my GitHub

My name is David and on here I upload some of the projects that I've worked on.

Some things about myself:

- I like taking risks (only look one way crossing a two way street)
- I'm a fast learner (the second time around)
- I love new challenges (what is love)
- I'm great at communicating (only useful until robots take over)
